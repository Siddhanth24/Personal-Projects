The code defines a database schema for a university system with tables for students, programs, courses, and enrollments.

The "students" table has columns for student_id (an integer primary key), first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, address, admission_date (date when the student was admitted), graduation_date (date when the student graduated, which may be null if they have not yet graduated), and program_id (a foreign key referencing the "programs" table).

The "programs" table has columns for program_id (an integer primary key), program_name (name of the program), and program_code (a short code for the program).

The "courses" table has columns for course_id (an integer primary key), course_name (name of the course), course_code (a short code for the course), and program_id (a foreign key referencing the "programs" table).

The "enrollments" table has columns for enrollment_id (an integer primary key), student_id (a foreign key referencing the "students" table), course_id (a foreign key referencing the "courses" table), enrollment_date (date when the student enrolled in the course), and grade (the grade the student received in the course, which may be null if the course has not yet been completed).

The code also includes some sample data for the "students", "programs", "courses", and "enrollments" tables.
