<p>Coorg or Kodagu as it is officially known now, is an astonishing land in the heart of the southern Indian peninsula. This unspoilt “country of million hills”, situated on the slopes of the Western Ghats, is India’s coffee bowl. The tiny district in the state of Karnataka is the biggest producer of coffee.
<li>Madikeri or Mercara as it was known when it was once ruled by the British, is the district headquarters and situated at an elevation of 1,140m. Dotted with red-tiled bungalows, the town has an old world charm about it. The British who colonized Coorg and set up coffee plantations prior to Independence, compared Coorg to Scotland as both the places had grand and regal highlands with a sturdy mountain-dwelling race. 
</li> 
<li>Geography: Coorg, a landlocked country, is not connected by train or air. It should be noted that Coorg is only a name of the district and there is no town by the name of Coorg.
Getting to Coorg: The only way to reach this nature’ s guarded resort is to motor down from Mysore, Mangalore or Hassan towns, all in the state of Karnataka or from Kannur or Tellicherry in Kerala state. Madikeri is 120 km from Mysore and 260 km from Bangalore.
 </li> 
<li>Coorg, sandwiched between Karnataka and Kerala States, is well-connected by bus service and is two hours drive from Mysore. The drive is worth it as one could enjoy miles of greenery, thick forests, acres and acres of coffee estates and shimmering streams</li>
